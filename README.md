# Number-Plate-Anonymiser

A Python interface for encrypting vehicle license plate data. Under GDPR, Transport Scotland can not interact with the raw number plate data if it could be used to identify people in conjunction with other datasets such as, the time when and location where the license plate was picked up on camera.

## Running the Processor
Once development has reached a stable state executable files will be provided for widespread use of this encryptor, however at present any user testing should be doing through a Python install. The use of Anaconda is recommended.

```
python main.py
```
