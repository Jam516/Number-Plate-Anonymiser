# Number-Plate-Anonymiser

A Python interface for encrypting vehicle license plate data. Under GDPR, Transport Scotland can not interact with the raw number plate data if it could be used to identify people in conjunction with other datasets such as, the time when and location where the license plate was picked up on camera.

## Running the Anonymiser
1. Download the latest release of the project (https://github.com/TransportScotland/Number-Plate-Anonymiser/releases). 
2. Unzip the number-plate-anonymiser folder
3. Run the number-plate-anonymiser.exe file that can be found in that folder. Note: It will not work if it is copied out of the folder.
